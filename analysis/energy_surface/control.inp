#Note 1
The options for the trajectory file are
- Firts number: Time step at which the history file is started to be writen 
- Second number: Frecuency to write the history file
- Third number: Content option:   0 ---> position
                                  1 ---> position and velocities
                                  2 ---> position, velocities, and forces
#Note 2
Pore information has three variable
First is where the pore starts in x direction
Second is the depth of the pore, i.e. depth of the simulation box in case of a slit pore
Third is the pore width that is accessible to the fluid, aka H*

#Note 3
The possible ensembles are:
- nvt_gau (nvt ensemble using the Evans thermostat)
- nvt_ber (nvt ensemble using the Berendsen thermosta)
- nvt_nos (nvt ensemble using the Nose-Hover thermostat)
